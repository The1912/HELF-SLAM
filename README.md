HELF-SLAM is a lightweight and efficient visual SLAM system that combines a hybrid learned frontend with a classical optimization backend.  
It achieves real-time performance on a single GPU with low memory usage while maintaining robustness under challenging conditions such as low texture, illumination changes, and motion blur.
